# Predictive-Insights
This project focuses on analyzing student performance data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Inferential Data Analysis techniques. The aim is to identify key factors that influence academic outcomes based on features such as attendance rate, study hours, parental support, extracurricular activities, and previous grades.

🔍 Project Objectives

Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle null values, encoding, normalization)

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to uncover trends and patterns

Visualize data using heatmaps, boxplots, histograms, and correlation matrices

Conduct inferential statistical analysis to draw meaningful insights

Identify relationships between variables such as study hours, attendance, and final grades

Support academic performance predictions using the insights gained

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handled missing values (median/mode imputation or row dropping)

Converted categorical features into numerical formats

Normalized selected numerical variables for consistent scaling

Removed inconsistencies and prepared cleaned dataset for analysis

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA section includes:

Distribution plots for numerical variables

Count plots for categorical features

Heatmap for visualizing missing values

Correlation matrix to understand relationships

Outlier detection using boxplots

StudyHours vs FinalGrade and Attendance vs Performance visualizations

📊 Inferential Data Analysis

Performed statistical testing to understand deeper relationships:

Hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square test)

Confidence intervals for mean performance

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare group differences

Evaluated whether attendance, parental support, or study hours significantly impact final grades

📝 Key Insights

Higher study hours and consistent attendance correlate strongly with better performance

Parental support shows moderate influence

Previous academic scores are strong predictors of final grades

Students with higher extracurricular involvement often show balanced academic outcomes

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

SciPy / Statsmodels (for inferential statistics)



📌 Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive look at how various academic and behavioral factors influence student performance. The insights can help institutions, educators, and researchers design better learning strategies and improve student outcomes.
